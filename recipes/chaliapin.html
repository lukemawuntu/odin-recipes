    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The <i>Chaliapin</i> Steak is an original Japanese steak. It is a dish made in 1936 for the Russian opera singer Feodor Chaliapin when he visited Japan. At the time, he was suffering from toothaches and said, "I want to eat a tender steak." This dish was devised to answer to his request.</p>
